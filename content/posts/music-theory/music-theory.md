Check this out after 30th second melody is little good I think.

Okay Bye I'll Improve this webpage as I learn more. ❤️

So After some tunes/music I thought how can I make it available for Apple Music or Spotify etc.
I don't have enough money to fund my this adventure. I am going all free options _wish me luck_.

I had choosed **Routenote** the music distributor. I had uploaded one of the tunes there Let's see when can I see all things up and running.

I'll give you link when it's all up and running thanks.
