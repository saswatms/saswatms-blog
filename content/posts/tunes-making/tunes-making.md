Hey, the music man is here.


So, you all should know I *LOVE* music💗.

## Listening?

Well I am listening from pop to indie, solo to orchestra, rap to classical, indian to afrobeats.

Since I had subscribed to Apple Music, I had discovered a new way to listening, **By Albums**.

I think you all should try that. I mean really It changed something about how I used to think what music is.

Here is my one of the [playlist](https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/smooth-out/pl.u-GgA5kaBhxygmmm9), just sharing.

## Creating

So not so fun part as an early stage. My music is no where near a music but whatever it is love or hate It's mine.
I love doing it in my spare time ✌️.

I am hoping to keep improving.

> May my any art never be perfect.

### My creation.
