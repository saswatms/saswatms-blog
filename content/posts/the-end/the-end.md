## Leave the things behind

As a way to go through your minds current state you need to pass some shit away from your mind and heart.
*declutter*

## What will come next?

Nobody know as of now. I am up for writing showing anything.
So grab a popcorn without caramelized else you'll have to pay tax.

So it seems I'll keep it short and **good bye, amigo**.

But at the same time I think I need to give you at least 1 minute of read time, else how you will engage in future posts?

Hmm. So the story begins when I was struggling to survive academically.
It was very hot may at *DTU*. The college of a kind.

It never had any good place in my heart. like an trauma till the day.

I took rickshaw from metro checked the phone, class was cancelled.

Oh we've got our 1 minute mark.

Final *good bye*
