Who the hell start their blog like that??

**I Do**

## Why?

> End is the beginning

They say, then I am up for giving it a chance. What happened previously, what will happen now?

*a way to slip through crack of time.*

## Leave the things behind

As a way to go through your mind’s current state, you need to pass some shit away from your mind and heart. *Declutter.*

## What will come next?

Nobody knows as of now. I am up for writing showing anything. So grab a popcorn without caramelization, else you’ll have to pay tax.

So it seems I'll keep it short and **good bye, amigo**.

But at the same time, I think I need to give you at least 1 minute of read time; else, how will you engage in future posts?

Hmm. So the story begins when I was struggling to survive academically. It was very hot May at **DTU**. The college of a kind.

It never had any good place in my heart, like a trauma till the day.

I took a rickshaw from the metro, checked the phone, and class was cancelled.

Oh, we’ve got our 1-minute mark.

Final *good bye*
